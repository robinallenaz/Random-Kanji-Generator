---

**Introduction**

This test has a total duration of **three (3) days**. This is a **take-home assessment**. 

Your instructor will designate at least half a day for you to work on this assessment in class. If you need more time, you have three additional days (including weekends and holidays) to work on your assessment. This assessment will be due at **5:00 PM** on the third day after it was assigned to your cohort.

# **Objectives**

This SBA will test your skills in creating a simple website with a clean layout and styling. Your website should have a well-developed HTML structure and follow good visual design methodologies in order to produce a satisfying user experience.

# **Scenario and Instructions**

In this Skill-based Assessment, you will be creating a small three-page website. The topic and content of your website is entirely up to you – be creative\! 

Your work will be graded based on the technical requirements listed in the following section. Creativity always works in your favor, so feel free to go beyond the scope of the listed requirements if you have time.

Since this is likely your first time creating a website, keep it simple. Keeping it simple ensures that you can complete this project within the given time. Like most projects you’ll encounter, you should finish the absolute requirements first, and *then* add complexity if you have time. This also gives you a better idea of what you can get done in the given time if you were to do it again with more requirements.

Once you have your website idea, approach your design with the user’s perspective in mind. User experience is one of the most important aspects of good web design. If users enjoy their time on your site, they are more likely to trust whatever services or information you offer, and more likely to come back and visit again.

For this project, don’t worry too much about the content of the site. There are many places you can find free content to display on your site, as listed below. Concentrate more on the website's structure and grid system.

**Resources for free content:**

* **Text:** [Lipsum](https://www.lipsum.com/), a Lorem Ipsum text generator.  
* **Images:** [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/), a resource for stock photos (and other media)  
* **GIFs:** [Motion Elements](https://www.motionelements.com/search/gif), a resource GIFs (and other media)
